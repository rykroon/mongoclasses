"""
Goals for version 0.4.0

- Possibly rename 'collection' classvar to 'mongodb_collection'.
    This way the name 'collection' isn't reserved.

- Additional documentation using mkdocs.
    - Show how mongoclasses can work well with other packages:
        - dacite (fromdict)
        - pydantic (pydantic dataclasses)

    - Show example of choosing which fields to update.
